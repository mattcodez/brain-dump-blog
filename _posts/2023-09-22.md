Just learned something in JS
```
> (new Array(5)).map(() => 'a')
[ <5 empty items> ]
> (new Array(5)).fill().map(() => 'a')
[ 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a' ]
```
If you create an array with a certain number of elements using the Array() constructor, you don't actually get an array with 5 undefined elements, rather you just get an array object with a length of 5. So certain iterative functions like map() won't run because the elements are considered non-existent/sparse. However, if we fill() with undefined, our map() runs as expected
